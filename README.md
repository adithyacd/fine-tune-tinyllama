# Fine-tune-tinyllama
Fine-tuning TinyLLaMA-1.1B using LoRA and Transformers with the dataset containing all English Premier League matches (Football) from 2018-2021.
---
This project shows how to fine-tune the **TinyLLaMA-1.1B-Chat** model using a method called LoRA, which helps reduce memory and compute usage. The fine-tuned model can give better and more specific responses. The code uses Hugging Face libraries and includes everything needed to train and test the model, even on a regular GPU.
